# PYDAOS-Programs
Program Descriptions:
- chunks.py: This program uploads a file in chunks of sizes specified by the user, and gives the time taken to upload the file in that many number of chunks. Can be used to experiment with different chunk sizes and see which one takes the least amount of time to upload.
